Creating a Client

To start working with this package, create a client that refers to the database
of interest:

    ctx := context.Background()
    client, err := spanner.NewClient(ctx, "projects/P/instances/I/databases/D")
    if err != nil {
        // TODO: Handle error.
    }
    defer client.Close()

Remember to close the client after use to free up the sessions in the session
pool.
